To run this application, please follow the steps below

1. First install docker for windows here https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/
2. Go to To-do-List-With-API project root directory
3. Open a Windows Terminal and run this command docker-compose up --build

Note: While running 'docker-compose up --build,' the backend will attempt to connect to the MySQL database, and it may throw a 'Connection Refused' exception because MySQL is not running during the first build. Please wait until the backend application successfully connects to the MySQL database.
